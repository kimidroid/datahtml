<h1>Robloxian Noob Boss Battle</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A boss battle with the theme of 2 playable characters from different games fighting each other. I had been suggested to make this by a friend for a video idea and hadn&#39;t seen anything like this made before. The map has custom model entities, custom music, and custom sound effects. Other than that, the boss battle itself has its own things and there is also somewhat of a story.&nbsp;<strong>Let&#39;s take a look</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the player strikes back at the noob because they&#39;ve been offended by their opinion on their favorite game;&nbsp;<strong>Minecraft</strong>, a big fight has begun between these two representatives of their favorite games. You will be the representative of Minecraft and battle towards victory and show who is superior between the voxel sandbox and the user-created platform. Minecraft vs Roblox, who will be the winner? You will fight toward the outcome in this boss battle.</p>

<p>The vicious noob has 3 special attacks to combat you.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Baller:&nbsp;</strong>The &nbsp;Noob throws a ball at you, this one is relatively easy to dodge but if are too close or not aware, you will be easily targeted and be knocked onto the ground (<strong>not die</strong>) so stay alert.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bomb:&nbsp;</strong>Though this attack sounds very dangerous, it is only lethal if you are way too close. You will have to be forced to move away from your spot if you are way too close to where the bomb is placed.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Tornado Kick:&nbsp;</strong>This Noob has learned this attack from a devious Rice Farmer, if you are hit by this attack it does more damage than a standard melee. You will be alerted by a boom.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Robloxian Noob is very fast and can get a hit on you very quickly, keep an eye on its moves, and don&#39;t be fooled if it stops randomly.</p>

<p>If you manage to defeat him, he won&#39;t give up. He might just give up all his attacks, but will use a hidden 4th that will surely blast you.</p>
